# OCR Deep Learning project

This OCR project contains two parts :
- Text Detection : This is the implementation made by Clova AI Research (CRAFT) containing pre-trained model
  - GitHub Repo : https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch
- Text Recognition : This is also the implementation made by Clova AI Research containing pre-trained model
  - GitHub Repo : https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark

Using these implementations we could set up a notebook to understand the model used and to apply on receipt to detect some informations and collect it on a json file.
This repository add the generation of json file and contains 60 images of receipt to test the models.
