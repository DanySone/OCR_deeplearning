# OCR Deep Learning project

This OCR project is composed of two parts :
- Text Detection : This is the implementation made by Clova AI Research (CRAFT) containing pre-trained model
  - GitHub Repo : https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch
- Text Recognition : This is also the implementation made by Clova AI Research containing pre-trained model

Using these implementations we could set up a notebook to understand the model used and to apply on receipt to detect some informations and collect it on a .json file.
